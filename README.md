# MOF-Binder-Composite
Files to reproduce the data presented in the paper "Microscopic insight into the shaping of MOFs and its impact on CO2 capture performance "

The "**Binder**" folder consists of four binder models and a Lammps input file used to equilibrate the structure. 

The "**Composite**" folder consists of CALF-20/Binder composite model and a Lammps input file used for MD simulation. 

The "**Diffusion**" folder consists of code used to calculate CO2 diffusion.
